# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of the Data Science Internship at SYNTECXHUB (Week 3 Task).

## 📌 Project Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset and analyze survival rates based on gender, passenger class, and age groups.

## 📊 Tasks Completed
- Loaded Titanic dataset using Seaborn
- Inspected dataset structure and missing values
- Analyzed survival rates by gender and passenger class
- Created age groups for deeper analysis
- Visualized findings using bar charts and boxplots
- Generated insight report

## 📈 Key Insights
- Females had significantly higher survival rates than males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Children had relatively higher survival probability.
- Passenger class and age played major roles in survival outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
